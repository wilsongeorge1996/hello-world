# hello-world

Hello Wilson of the future,

I'm writing this to learn how this GitHub thing works.
So far I've created a new repository with a readme file in it. Then i've created a new branch from the main (master) branch.
Branches are copies of the main file. They are created to make any edits to the main file.
Usually, these edits are done by different people working on the same project, and the edits are applied after you "commit" them and "pull" them into the main project.
Correction: You make edits to the branch file and "commit" the changes. After you commit you make a "Pull request". This applies the changes made on the branch to the main project.
